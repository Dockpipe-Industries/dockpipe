## Bounded Implementation Order

1. Freeze all 45 current files and current emitted artifacts as the `v0.0.0.1` compatibility lane.
2. Introduce source-set/file identities, strict UTF-8, full spans, and structured diagnostics without
   adding syntax.
3. Replace string-only type plumbing with structured unresolved/resolved `TypeRef` and create one
   symbol table with explicit ownership and declaration spans, still preserving legacy behavior.
4. Add explicit module/import/dependency-lock binding and deterministic resolution before any broad
   declaration or expression expansion.
5. Add stable semantic IDs end to end through diagnostics and a versioned semantic projection;
   keep local implementation symbols ID-optional.
6. Establish typed HIR and target-neutral Core IR with one tiny pure executable function and the
   deterministic Go backend; prove no direct parser-to-Go emission.
7. Add fixed numeric/text/value/equality/hash/order semantics plus optionals, results, records,
   unions, and deterministic collections in coherent vertical slices.
8. Add blocks, locals, branches, bounded loops, matching, and functions sufficient for the compiler
   subset, with negative flow/ownership/profile tests.
9. Add inert effects, executable entrypoints, contracts, actions/state, replay, and first-class
   testing on the established compiler representations.
10. Publish the shared semantic/Core projection builders, then let TASK-020 and TASK-022 define
    separately versioned Application IR and Service IR specializations without reparsing.
11. Implement the compiler in the accepted PipeLang subset, complete the minimum self-hosting
    library, and prove stage-0/stage-1/stage-2 reproducibility.
12. Validate full, constrained, and MCU profiles with resolver capability manifests and explicit
    unsupported-feature diagnostics before widening libraries or adding another backend.

Each slice is independently reviewable and keeps syntax, semantics, diagnostics, projection,
editor, tests, and any enabled backend synchronized. No permissive parser, target-owned semantics,
or syntax-first feature batch may skip the earlier foundations.

## Validation Matrix

Every shipped language slice needs proportionate coverage across:

- lexer/parser positive, malformed, ambiguity, recovery, and source-span cases;
- semantic-ID malformed, duplicate, rename/move stability, compatibility, and metadata cases;
- effect inference/composition, undeclared widening, pure/effectful call, authority, and inertness
  cases;
- requires/ensures/invariant/refinement positive, violation, composition, and compatibility cases;
- deterministic replay identity, injected nondeterminism, sensitive-value redaction, and exact seed
  cases;
- property generation, invalid/boundary generation, shrinking, replay, and contract-derived cases;
- state-machine legal/prohibited/terminal/unreachable transition and bounded path-generation cases;
- typechecker positive and negative cases, including optionals, collections, branches, actions, and
  effect purity boundaries;
- deterministic evaluator and computed-dependency behavior;
- compiler golden artifacts and repeat-build identity;
- old-version compatibility fixtures;
- CLI compile/invoke/materialize behavior and help;
- catalog/workflow projection compatibility;
- VS Code/Cursor syntax, completion, hover, and diagnostics;
- semantic graph/impact query and independently verified change-manifest cases;
- source-map/symbol/value-projection, semantic-breakpoint, sanitized debug-bundle determinism and
  redaction, and Core/backend differential-debug cases for each enabled executable backend;
- TASK-020 Application IR and TASK-022 Service IR integration fixtures with no target-specific
  language symbols;
- Core IR conformance and differential results for each enabled backend/profile; and
- stage-0/stage-1/stage-2 normalized artifact, diagnostic, behavior, and digest equality.

Run at minimum the focused `src/lib/pipelang` and application PipeLang tests for implementation
slices, then the broader engine/package validation required by the touched public surfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The language decisions above are explicit before production syntax is accepted.
- Existing PipeLang behavior and artifacts remain compatible or migrate through an explicit version.
- Stable semantic IDs survive file moves and symbol renames, reject duplicates, and appear
  consistently in diagnostics, metadata, tests, graphs, and compatibility analysis without being
  forced onto local implementation details.
- Public effect/authority contracts are machine-readable, compositional, enforceable, and cannot be
  silently widened through calls or target generation.
- Contracts/invariants/refinements have deterministic enforcement and reusable normalized metadata.
- Pure code cannot observe nondeterministic or external state without an explicit effect/input.
- Seeded property failures and deterministic executions can be replayed exactly within the declared
  compatibility and sensitive-data boundary.
- Enums, records, optionals, collection values, computed properties, reactive state, bounded actions,
  governed effects, and safe expressions form one coherent type system rather than isolated syntax.
- Pure compilation/evaluation remains deterministic, offline, and side-effect-free.
- Effect declarations cannot execute during compile, catalog, editor, render, or target build setup.
- Workflow/package/runtime/resolver/strategy authority remains the only external execution path.
- PipeLang contains no Qt, HTML, CSS, QML, JavaScript, C++, CMake, or WASM semantics.
- AST/parser/typechecker/evaluator/compiler/CLI/docs/editor support stay synchronized.
- Diagnostics carry stable source locations through the semantic projection.
- Enabled executable backends retain reversible PipeLang source/symbol/value mappings and emit
  deterministic sanitized debug evidence consumable by both IDE and structured tooling clients.
- The semantic graph produces dependency-kind-aware impact results rather than text-match claims.
- Change manifests are independently verified and never treated as trusted agent assertions.
- External model invocation is an explicit typed resolver-backed effect and is absent from ordinary
  programs unless declared.
- TASK-020 can consume the projection without parsing `.pipe` files independently.
- One minimal application fixture compiles through both semantic-web and Qt target fixtures with
  equivalent typed state, action, validation, and effect semantics.
- PipeLang is capable of expressing its compiler and minimum library, and the staged Go-seeded
  bootstrap contract is reproducible.
- Numeric, Unicode text, equality, hashing, ordering, value/reference, nullability, failure,
  mutation, collection, memory, module, distribution, and entrypoint semantics are target-neutral
  and fail rather than degrade on unsupported profiles.
- Typed HIR, Core IR, the public semantic projection, Application IR, and Service IR remain distinct
  layers over one parser/binder/type contract.
